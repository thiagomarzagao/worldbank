It may be that the people who are already retired in their 50s have retired early due to health problems. Hence it would be no surprise to find that they die younger than the average American. That could help explain why the distribution is a bit skewed to the left. If we dropped everyone who retired because of health issues the mean would probably go up and maybe even surpass the means for the overall American population.

Identifying cases of health-related retirement might be difficult (privacy issues, etc) though, so perhaps a more feasible approach would be to compare the lifespan of World Bank retirees to the lifespan of the overall population of retirees. (Assuming of course that the World Bank does not have peculiar retirement rules that might affect the comparison.) We could also compare the World Bank retirees to retirees of similar income and schooling, as life expectancy varies with these variables.

Finally, another potential problem with the email's conclusions is that the World Bank has employees all over the world, so it might not make sense to compare their lifespans to those of the American population. It may be that most of the bank's employees are in developing countries, where life expectancy tends to be lower. That could be yet another reason why we see a left-skewed distribution. We'd need to break down the data and do within-country comparisons. (Though perhaps World Bank employees are highly mobile and switch countries frequently, in which case it might not make sense to compare World Bank retirees in country X to the overall population of retirees in country X.)
